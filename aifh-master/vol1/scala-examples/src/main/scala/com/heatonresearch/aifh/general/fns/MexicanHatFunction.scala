/**
 * The Mexican Hat, or Ricker wavelet, Radial Basis Function.
 * <p/>
 * It is usually only referred to as the "Mexican hat" in the Americas, due to
 * cultural association with the "sombrero". In technical nomenclature this
 * function is known as the Ricker wavelet, where it is frequently employed to
 * model seismic data.
 * <p/>
 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Hat_Function
 * Construct the Mexican Hat RBF. Each RBF will require space equal to (dimensions + 1) in the params vector.
 *
 * @param theDimensions The number of dimensions.
 * @param theParams     A vector to hold the parameters.
 * @param theIndex      The index into the params vector.  You can store multiple RBF's in a vector.
