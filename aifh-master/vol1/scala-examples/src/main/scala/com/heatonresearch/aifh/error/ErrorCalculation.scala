 * An error calculation metric calculates the difference between two vector sets.  One vector set will be the ideal
 * expected output from a Machine Learning Algorithm.  The other vector set is the actual output.  Training a
 * Machine Learning Algorithm typically involves minimizing this error.

 * Error calculation metrics are very similar to distance metrics.  However, an error calculation metric operates over
 * a set of vectors, whereas a distance metric operates over just two vectors.
