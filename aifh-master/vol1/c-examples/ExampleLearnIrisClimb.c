/*
This example uses hill climbing to fit a RBF network to the Iris data set.  Hill climbing will give very mixed results.
My example below trained below 0.11 in 101 iterations.  Sometimes it will be much better.  I've seen examples train to under 0.01
in only a handful of iterations.   This is because the initial random position of the RBF network was pretty good.  Often you 
ÃŸwill need considerably more iterations for a considerably worse outcome.
